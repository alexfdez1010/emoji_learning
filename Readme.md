Learning a new language can be quite challenging, as it often requires leveraging the foundations of languages you already know. To address this challenge and capitalize on a universally understood form of communication, this project harnesses the power of emojis to facilitate language learning for individuals from any cultural background. By integrating the universal appeal of emojis with the proven method of spaced repetition learning, this project creates a dynamic deck of cards featuring emojis alongside their descriptions in the language you aspire to learn. These decks are compatible with Anki, the leading spaced-repetition application and also open source, allowing for a seamless import into your Anki app to kickstart your learning journey.

You can download Anki for free [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
